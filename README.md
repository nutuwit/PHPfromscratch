# PHP From Scratch
Any progress toward learning PHP as a secondary backend language by executing via server-side language.  

Server-side code is executed on the server. It is not accessible from the browser. Only the output from the code is accessible. Unlike, the client-side code e.g. JS is executed within the browser. All client-side code is visible to the user in the source code.
